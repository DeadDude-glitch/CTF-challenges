I created a meme and to prevent it from getting stolen I created an archive file with a password to hide it, unfortunately I forgot the password and the hint didn't help, can you restore it? 

I wrote it in a weird way which is by replacing some characters with signs and numbers or just makes them capitals to strengthen it
'a' -> 'a' , 'A' , '4' , '@'
'o' -> 'O' , 'o' , '0'
'r' -> 'R' , 'r'
's' -> 's' , 'S' , '5' , '$'
